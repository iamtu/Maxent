You need to find out exactly what your TA is basing the airfare quote on and I m not sure that the Insight air price includes taxes and surcharges etc which these days can easily add 300 to the cost of a flight to Europe You:need need:to to:find find:out out:exactly exactly:what what:your your:TA TA:is is:basing basing:the the:airfare airfare:quote quote:on on:and and:I I:m m:not not:sure sure:that that:the the:Insight Insight:air air:price price:includes includes:taxes taxes:and and:surcharges surcharges:etc etc:which which:these these:days days:can can:easily easily:add add:300 300:to to:the the:cost cost:of of:a a:flight flight:to to:Europe,1
